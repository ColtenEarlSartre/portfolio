## Description

This is a portfolio I've created to showcase the projects and websites that I'll be creating during my time at Epicodus.  I plan on continuing to keep this page updated in order to demonstrate everything I learn.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

This webpage has no setup or installation requirements.

## Known Bugs

There are no known bugs at this time.
## Support and contact details

Please reach out to me at colten.carpenter@icloud.com if you have any feedback, questions, or concerns that you'd like to share with me in regards to this site.

## Technologies Used

This site makes use of basic web-buiding technologies such as CSS,Bootstrap, and HTML.  I was able to implement a few exotic fonts thanks to Google Fonts (https://fonts.google.com/).
